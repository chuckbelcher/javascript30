    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //result 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //result 200 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Bub';
    console.log(team, players); //note that players was updated becuase team is a reference to players.

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() //makes a copy of the array not a reference
    team2[3] = "Youda";



    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players); //makes a copy of the array not a reference
    team3[2] = "Nancy";

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team4 = [...players];
    team5 = Array.from(players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = "Mac";
    team5[4] = "McDoogle";
    console.log(team5, team4, team3, team2, team, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      number: 44
    };
    console.log(person);
    // and think we make a copy:
    //this will make a reference not a copy same as with the array
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain, person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const major = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 22, gender: 'male' }); //makes a copoy of the object, add gender and changes number
    console.log(major, captain, person);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
